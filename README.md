# Cozy Planner

Gamified adventurer themed planner to help track goals that are too big to break down in one sitting. 

##  Overview

I built this planner to help me track large tasks and goals that felt overwhelming to break down in one sitting. Instead of forcing a rigid structure, the planner allows me to track progress through flexible checkpoints, making it easier to stay on top of long-term objectives.

To make the process more engaging, I themed it after fantasy adventuring, turning goal-setting into a more motivating experience. Additionally, I included a mood tracker to reflect on my progress holistically—categorizing days as good, bad, or unmotivated—helping me identify patterns in productivity and motivation over time.
